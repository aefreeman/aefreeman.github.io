		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<br>
		Welcome to my page!<br><br>
		I am a recent graduate of Stanford University, where I obtained my Master's degree in Data Science. 
		<br><br>
		This website is meant to highlight some of the work that I have done and am currently working on, as well as serving as a central respoitory for me to maintain my various projects. 
		<br><br>
		One of my current projects is my <a href = "modeling_toolkit/landing_page.html">Modeling Toolkit</a>. While the math involved in data science can get quite messy, I believe that most models can be easily explained to a non-technical person. That (with, admittedly, some of the math) is the idea of the Toolkit. Once completed, I hope the Toolkit will offer a central location for models so that if someone (i.e. me) comes across a new problem, they can flip through and find an appropriate model to try. 
		<br><br>
		My other projects are more "hobby" projects that came up from interesting questions, such as "has there ever been a 1-8-6 double play in the MLB?" (yes, in the <a href = "https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHA/PHA191607122.shtml">top of the 7th</a> of the St. Louis Browns against the Philadelphia Athletics way back in 1916) or "in <a href = "https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/playoffs.htm">2015</a>, why did the 10-6 Jets miss the playoffs while the 9-7 Texans didn't, and how do we fix this?".
		<br><br>
		While I am a very passionate data scientist, one thing I am not is a web designer, so please excuse any formatting issues you may find on this site.
