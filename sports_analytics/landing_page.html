		<h2>About</h2>
		These projects are various sports-related projects that I have worked on. Personally, I really enjoy baseball, football, and hockey, and I'm a huge Boston/New England fan (which is one of the reasons I chose the image on the right for this page).
		<br><br>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Projects:</h3>
		<a href = "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andrew.freeman5528/viz/Baseball_16485193580130/Dashboard1?publish=yes">Baseball Game Day Map</a> (2022)
		<br>
		&emsp;<b>Key Idea</b>: If you were to plan a baseball roadtrip (like I did), where could you go? This shows all major and minor league games by day. You can also select a team you like to see where they are playing each day.
		<br>
		&emsp;<i>Note</i>: The data on this page was last updated on March 29, 2022, so some games may have been rescheduled/moved.
		<br><br>
		<a href = "NFL_Playoffs/Revamping_Playoffs.html">Revamping the NFL Playoff System</a> (2020)
		<br>
		&emsp;<b>Key Idea</b>: In the NFL, the best 6 (now 7) teams don't always make the playoffs. Let's fix that.
		<br><br>
		<a href = "https://double-play-dash.herokuapp.com/">MLB Double Play Tracker</a> (2019)
		<br>
		&emsp;<b>Key Question</b>: Which combinations of MLB double plays have occurred? A 1-8-6? A 6-7-5?
		<br>
